The Trianglecash is working to address this problem, and it released its reform proposal last March. Pew recently published an issue brief summarizing the bureau’s complicated plan. Overall, the proposal would transform the market in positive ways and has the potential to connect consumers with safer, lower-cost loans that better serve borrowers’ needs. It rightly emphasizes ensuring affordable payments and safe loan structures, requiring that most products become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments. That is what the vast majority of borrowers want, according to Pew’s survey research. 

Certain important modifications are needed, however. The proposal does not do enough to control the risk that lenders will build excessively long durations and unreasonable costs into installment loans. For example, lenders currently offer a $500 loan for which borrowers pay $1,126 in fees over an 18-month payment period. This loan could continue to exist under the CFPB’s proposal. As written, the plan still makes it too easy for lenders to offer dangerous loans and a little too hard for them to provide safe ones.
