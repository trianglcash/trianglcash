It is not every day that Congress creates a new federal regulator, let alone one with authority to change an entire market in ways that will help millions of Americans. But that is what happened in 2010, when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was formed as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law created to better protect consumers from harmful financial products, including, specifically, payday loans. Now, five years later, we have seen the first outline of what the bureau will do with this mandate.

Pew research has found that payday loans, and similar products such as auto title loans, hurt millions of borrowers annually. A typical payday loan is for $375 and is due in full in just two weeks. With fees, this lump-sum payment consumes 36 percent of a typical borrower’s pretax paycheck, which is just too much for most people to handle. In fact, most payday loans are taken out to cover shortfalls created by paying back a previous payday loan. The average borrower ends up in debt for nearly half the year and pays more than $520 in fees for that $375 loan.
